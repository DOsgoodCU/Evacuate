- Community interaction revealing to everyone

- Caribbean workshop on events, rainfall, and forecasts
	- Worst storms were the ones that hit on holidays, not necessarily the strongest storms
	- Focus group holiday outcome was verified with research
	- Massive implications for disaster preparedness and planning 
- But we can only do so many focus groups…
- So, we spent a lot of time and money on technology to help automate 
- Decades of work in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America have yielded new approaches, tools
	- Quantitative hybrid in-person/computerized focus groups became possible at large-scale (many thousands of meetings, millions of people served)

## Farmers themselves generated better satellite flood and drought models than ever designed before.
