# IKON Game: Colombia Lessons

![](ikonwinnercolombia.jpg)

- Prize given to best scoring.
- 146 played, and they invited others
- Average player played 200 rounds
- Winner, 16-year-old with her grandmother.
- Women were more accurate than men
- Prizes 
	- Didn’t improve reporting quality
	- Did increase participation
- Most people played for fun, not accuracy
- Everyone might learn…but the information-gathering goal is to identify super trainers, who are about 20% of players who are very accurate--use their responses, understand biases

## Idea: Make the game configurable by the Emergency or Disaster Manager.
