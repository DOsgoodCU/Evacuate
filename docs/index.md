## Coordination is hard when people must commit to choices.

- Government leadership plays a central role
- Many individuals/families commit to their own choices
- Massive amount occurring in the informal domain

Not only communicating data:

- Inform people, learn from people, coordinate decisions

We have over a decade of tools and platforms to support this governance, information exchange, and coordinated decision making

Early US work:

- Drought information, water markets, and farm planting choices 
- Coordinating seed planting in Arizona

This work was performed by the Wu Lab in the Department of Computer Science and the National Center for Disaster Preparedness in the Climate School, both at Columbia University.  The US National Science Foundation funded much of the software infrastructure used.
